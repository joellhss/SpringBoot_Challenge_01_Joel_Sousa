# Cars API
Start using the URI `/cars`.
```
POST requests: /cars
GET requests: /cars/{chassiId}
```

## About the project
This project was developed for the first challenge of the Compass scholarship program. For this Java project, Spring Boot technology was utilized along with the following dependencies: Data JPA, JDBC, Thymeleaf, and Spring Web. Furthermore, for data persistence, the MySQL database running in a Docker container was used.

Since this is a fictional project, please take into account that, for the purposes of this project, the chassiId is automatically generated by the system itself. We can envision that the system's objective is to assign chassis numbers to the cars being manufactured.

## Instructions

### Connection to the database

Before running this application, you must have the MySQL DBMS running on your machine. The default user used is:

```
user: root
password: root
```

Another important requirement is that you create a schema or database with the name: `db_car`. After these steps, you will be ready to run the application.

*If you need to run this application in another DBMS or with other configurations, don't forget to change the application.properties settings and add the dependencies in the pom.xml file.*

    "fabricationYear": "2018/2019"
}
```
